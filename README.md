# JENGA
Project JENGA (Just Everything Needed for Ground Architecture) is a a final project in the Spring 2019 semester of MEIE 4810 Introduction to Human Spaceflight.

Our technique at involves using a black body balloon (which we will likely simulate using a helium balloon) to generate buoyancy in the Martian atmosphere. The balloon will be connected via tether to four base stations spread out at equal distances and angles from each other. The balloon will be maneuvered over the construction site by varying the lengths of the tethers.
This repo is the site of the software developed for the project.
